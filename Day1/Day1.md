Q1:Define a function named multiply that takes two numbers as parameters and returns their product. Write code to test this function with different input values.

Q2:Write a function called greeting that takes a name as a parameter and returns a string that says "Hello, [name]!". Use template literals to construct the string. Write code to test this function with different input values.

Q3:Create an arrow function that takes an array of numbers and returns the sum of those numbers. Write code to test this function with different input arrays.

Q4:Define a function called calculateBMI that takes a person's weight (in kilograms) and height (in meters) as parameters and returns their Body Mass Index (BMI). The formula for BMI is weight / (height \* height). Write code to test this function with different input values.

Q6:Define a function named reverseString that takes a string as a parameter and returns the reverse of that string. Write code to test this function with different input values.

Q7:Write an arrow function that takes an object representing a person's name (with properties first and last) and returns a string that says "Hello, [first] [last]!". Use template literals to construct the string.
Write code to test this function with different input values.

Q8:Define a function called capitalize that takes a string as a parameter and returns the same string with the first letter capitalized. Write code to test this function with different input values.

Q9:Write an arrow function that takes an array of strings and returns a new array with all the strings capitalized. Use the map method to apply the capitalization to each element. Write code to test this function with different input arrays.

Q10:Define a function named isPalindrome that takes a string as a parameter and returns true if the string is a palindrome (i.e., it reads the same forwards and backwards) and false otherwise. Write code to test this function with different input values.
